1
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,243
Easy, boy.

2
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,277
What do you expect?
They're savages.

3
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,779
One lot steals a goat from another lot,

4
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,240
before you know it
they're ripping each other to pieces.

5
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,826
I've never seen wildlings do a thing like this.

6
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,120
I never seen a thing like this,
not ever in my life.

7
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,414
How close did you get?

8
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,959
- Close as any man would.
- We should head back to the Wall.

9
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:34,046
Do the dead frighten you?

10
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,299
Our orders were to track the wildlings.

11
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:39,635
We tracked them.
They won't trouble us no more.

12
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,179
You don't think he'll ask us how they died?

13
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,225
Get back on your horse.

14
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,441
Whatever did it to them
could do it to us.

15
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,151
They even killed the children.

16
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,112
It's a good thing we're not children.

17
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,283
You want to run away south,
run away.

18
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,328
Of course,
they will behead you as a deserter.

19
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,580
If I don't catch you first.

20
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,251
Get back on your horse.

21
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,712
I won't say it again.

22
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,329
Your dead men seem
to have moved camp.

23
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,706
They were here.

24
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:55,753
See where they went.

25
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,135
What is it?

26
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:46,554
It's...

27
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,091
Go on, Father's watching.

28
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,011
And your mother.

29
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:05,521
Fine work, as always.
Well done.

30
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,314
Thank you.

31
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,277
I love the detail that you've managed
to get in these corners.

32
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,195
Quite beautiful.
