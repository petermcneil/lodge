# try and export as library
# This is the "physical" (i.e. real) name of the library.
# The actual file name of the library built is constructed based on conventions
# of the native platform, such as lib<LIBRARY_TARGET_NAME>.a,
# lib<LIBRARY_TARGET_NAME>.dylib or <LIBRARY_TARGET_NAME>.lib.
#
# In order to use a library name LIBRARY_TARGET_NAME that is not the same as the
# `EXPORT` used in the `install` command (see the end of this file), it is
# required to use `FIRST_TARGET` option of the `install_basic_package_files`
# command in the main CMakeLists.txt file with the name of one of the exported
# targets. `FIRST_TARGET` option defaults to LIBRARY_TARGET_NAME.
# By using setting LIBRARY_TARGET_NAME to ${PROJECT_NAME} it is not necessary to
# use `FIRST_TARGET` option in the main CMakeLists.txt.
# In general, in a C++ project, there is at least one exported target whose
# name is always know. Consequently, `FIRST_TARGET` option in the main
# CMakeLists.txt can be statically set to such target name. In the context of
# projects where users may choose what target to export, thus the name of a
# target may change at configure time, you can use propagate back to parent
# CMakeLists.txt, up to the main one, a variable containing the name of a
# target. In order to do it, you can use `set` command with `PARENT_SCOPE`
# option, see https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/set.html.

# You can add an external dependency using the find_package() function call
# See: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html
# Note that the imported objects resulting from the find_package() depends upon
# the configuration files generated by the developer of the library.
# These imported objects can be either:
#  - variables that must be used to include directories and/or link libraries
#    with function calls like target_include_directories() and/or
#    target_link_libraries();
#  - a CMake target that must only be linked using target_link_libraries() and
#    CMake will take care of including and/or linking the appropriate
#    directories and/or libraries.
# See: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_include_directories.html
# See: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_link_libraries.html
# For example:
# find_package(FooPackage) may import either
#  - variables: FooPackage_INCLUDE_DIRS and FooPackage_LIBRARIES
#  - target: FooPackage::FooPackage

# Adds a library target called ${LIBRARY_TARGET_NAME} to be built from the
# source and header files listed in the command invocation.

# Within this project, you can link to this library by just specifing the name
# of the target, i.e. ${LIBRARY_TARGET_NAME} = LibTemplateCMake. It is useful,
# however, to define an alias of this library with the scope of the exported
# library itself because (1) you will link against it with the exact same syntax
# of an imported library and (2) because names having a double-colon (::) are
# always treated as the name of either an alias or imported target. Any attempt
# to use such a name for a different target type will result in an error.

# Specify include directories for both compilation and installation process.

# If you used find_package() you need to use target_include_directories() and/or

# - with imported target:
